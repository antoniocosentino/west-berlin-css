## About

After reading the book "[West Berlin in Grafik Design](https://optikbooks.de/a5-west-berlin-grafikdesign-buch/)" by Jens MÃ¼ller I was inspired by the style of the artworks showcased in the book. The book is in fact featuring the great work of designers such as Anton Stankowski, Christian Chruxin, Ott+Stein and many others.

What amazed me is how these designs were still able to impress and to give a modern feel even 40 years after their original creation.

I decide therefore, as a sort of experiment, to try to re-create some of these iconic artworks by using only CSS. All the experiments are hosted on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/collection/AMkroy).

The project is still ongoing and I'm planning to add some new material on a regular basis.
